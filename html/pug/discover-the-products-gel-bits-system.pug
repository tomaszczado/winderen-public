            p One of the priorities we set when designing the Gel Bits System bits was its compliance with FEI requirements. Thanks to that we were able to design a bit that meets guidelines of the jumping, dressage and eventing rules:
        div(class='columns')
          div(class='column')
            div(class='item') Horses that have problems with getting on the bit and yielding to the hand
            div(class='item') Sensitive horses that have difficulty accepting a metal mouthpiece
            div(class='item') Horses that destroy synthetic bits by chewing on them
            div(class='item') Smooth surface of the bit
            div(class='item') Made of synthetic, durable material
            div(class='item') All mouthpiecesâ€™ hardness allowed by the rules
          div(class='column')
            div(class='item') Tongue relief port with acceptable height
            div(class='item') 18 mm thickness, suitable for both horses and ponies
            div(class='item') cheekpieces allowed for dressage (loose ring, eggbutt, D-ring and baucher)
            div(class='item') the shape of the curb bit and all lengths of cheekpieces allowed by the rules
            div(class='item') white and orange bit color not forbidden in all disciplines
