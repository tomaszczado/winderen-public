        div(class='inner-content') The concern of a solid and unchangeable foot position in the stirrup is faced by many riders. During our researches, it turned out that in most cases stirrups move or fall out because of micromovements in the rigid connection point of stirrup leather with the stirrup. Our absorber-system, to a large extent, prevents that phenomenon, allowing the riders to feel a stable and comfortable leg position while jumping over fences and also during flat work. Simultaneously our stirrups significantly reduce the risk of shifting or losing a stirrup, leading to the loss balance often caused by stiff stirrups.
