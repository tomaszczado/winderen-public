        <h2>How it all started</h2>
        <div class="content">For us at Winderen, horses have always been our greatest passion and a part of life. Years of experience in the saddle along with our vast expertise in industrial design and technology led us to the first innovative solutions for horses and riders that were not yet available on the market – and this is how Winderen was born.<br><br>Whenever we saw an opportunity to improve our own comfort and that of our horses, and the equestrian market was not offering up any satisfying solutions, we would often develop our own. In this way, our professional experience became increasingly intertwined with our hobby.</div>

                <div class="text">Each of us has heard these words from the trainer many times. There is nothing surprising about it - after all, legs are key riding aids. However, while fulfilling their function, they are subjected to enormous loads while riding. Dr. Sheila Schils, in her scientific research „Biomechanics of Jumping”, calculated that during landing after a jump of 120 cm height, the leading leg on which the horse lands is loaded with a force of approx. 2 tons. A large part of this energy is transferred to the rider who absorbs it while landing „on the stirrup”. The situation is similar during dressage work. While posting the trot or in a light seat, the entire body weight rests completely on the stirrups. Knowing that horse riding is a unique discipline in which the legs are subjected continuously to enormous, unnatural overloads, we have created Knee Protect Solution stirrups. Its unique double kinetic energy absorbers system significantly reduces the load on the knees and ankles while riding.</div>

                <div class="text">No horse was born with a saddle on its back - this obvious conclusion often guides our ideas and gives us a certain design direction. This is why we strive for our equipment to cause the least possible amount of discomfort for the horse, not disrupt its natural movement and physiology, and at the same time help riders to use the aids correctly. Equestrian performance aims at achieving maximum relaxation for both the horse and the rider. Such harmony, without overloads or discomfort, ensures the most effective, healthy and enjoyable training.</div>

                <div class="text">
                    The development process is like working with a young horse - sometimes you have to take a step back in order to move two steps forward.<br><br>When creating each product we first prepare prototypes, often very different from each other. We change and improve them a lot until we achieve the most satisfying result. In the beginning, we test all the prototypes ourselves with our horses and then pass them on to our fellow riders of various experience levels. We gather all their thoughts and observations, and after thorough analysis, we draw conclusions and transform them into improvements. We repeat the process of developing, testing and improving until it works the best, so it often takes many years. The road to the final result may be long and challenging, but every effective solution is always worth it.</div>
